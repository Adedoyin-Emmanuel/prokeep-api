# Prokeep API ðŸš€

This is a simple API built ASP.NET. I built this API to learn how building API's works in ASP.NET. This API is built with DOTNET 8, Entity Framework Core 8 and Postgres Database.

## Why I built this API ðŸ¤”

I built this API to learn how building API's works in ASP.NET. This is part of my **C#Journey**. You can find that here.

## Resources ðŸ‘œ

As usual, I'm going to list out the resources I used to build this API. I'm using Youtube and <https://roadmap.sh>. I use <https://roadmap.sh> to check what I've to learn and then watch them on Youtube.
